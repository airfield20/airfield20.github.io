This is a mostly printed cantilevered toolbox, designed by me. It features 2 lockable compartments and an optional hind leg for stability. The walls and bottoms of the box are purposely made very thick for added durability and drop resistance. 

The entire kit can be assembled with an assortment pack of m6 bolts and the tolerances are very large to make this printable on imprecise printers. 

You will need a bed at least 300mm bed size to print the toolbox however, I'm sure it would assemble well even if it were split into parts.

Here is a video of it in action! Please leave a like or comment on youtube if you like the design. Thank you.
