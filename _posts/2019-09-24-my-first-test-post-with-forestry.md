# Hi I'm Aaron, I like to build <div id="2">robots</div>

This is my first blog post on my new site, hosted through GitHub. This site will contain blog posts about my various projects (successes and failures).   
  
I had a blog before (afchacks.wordpress.com) but it's hosted through wordpress and is not as flexible as using GitHub. Here I can create blog posts using Markdown, textile, or html easily. I can even write posts from the command line. I may add those projects from my previous blog to this blog for reference.

I am passionate about studying complex systems such as robotics, simulation, code-quality assurance, automotive drivetrain, railway systems, VR gaming, etc...

My posts will be technical in nature and will either be about projects I am working on, past projects, potential future projects, or just my thoughts about a particular piece of technology or industry.
